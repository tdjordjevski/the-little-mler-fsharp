# The Little MLer (with solutions in F#)

I thought it would be fun to solve the exercises in this book using F#. The result is this repo.

## About the book

This book is out of print. I was able to find a copy in excellent condition for a cheap price (under $20). It was one of those situtations of being "in the right place at the right time", since it's [not so cheap anymore.](https://www.abebooks.com/servlet/SearchResults?kn=9780262561143)

If you've already read [The Little Schemer](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/little-schemer-fourth-edition), you won't get much out of this book. It will, however, help you start thinking about recursive types. For that alone, I would recommend this book (assuming you can find it at reasonable price).

You may also be interested in [Peter Krumins' repo](https://github.com/pkrumins/the-little-mler). It's more thorough than mine and is written in SML.
